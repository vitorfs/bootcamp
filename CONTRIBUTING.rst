=====================
Pull Request Process
=====================

If you wish to make suggestions to this project's code, please keep this few considerations in mind before pushing your **Pull Requests**:

* Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
* Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
* This project code is a work in progress, so there is always room for improvement, but there is no need to impoverish the code base quality; have that in mind when submitting your suggestions and **Pull Requests**.
* Until a better release cycle is implemented,the branch **master** is the most recent, most stable code base.
* Always push your **PR** to *develop* branch, any other will not be considered, and giving the case is easy to do, we guess there will be no difficulties with that.
* Any code submitted should have it's own UnitTest added inside the same code structure the project has right now.
* This projects uses PyTest, Coverage, Flake8 and PyLint for testing and static analysis, install them and use them for your development process.
* Before submitting code to the project, run PyTest on the code base, just type `pytest` to run the UnitTest on the code, is your responsibility to guarantee all the test pass and at least to keep the same coverage level previous to your changes.
* PyTest runs Coverage at the end of the process, and throws a brief report, simpler than the traditional one called with `coverage report -m`, which you also are still able to run if there is need for a more detailed version.
* Before submitting code to the project, run Flake8 and PyLint (which we are still tuning so beware of false alarms there, if you detect them, feel free to fix it through your **PR**), look at the reports and fix those lines where there is need to.
* Try your best to validate your signature on GitHub, that way your commits will be signed and validated by the platform.
